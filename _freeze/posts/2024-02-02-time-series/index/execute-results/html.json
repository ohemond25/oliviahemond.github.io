The Willamette Falls Fishway consists of three fish ladders that facilitate the movement of fish across the waterfalls. This passage is especially important for migratory species, such as salmon and steelhead trout, which must migrate upstream to spawn. The data used for these analyses come from scientific observations of the fish passing through the ladders of this fishway.\n\n*Data source:* Columbia River DART.
