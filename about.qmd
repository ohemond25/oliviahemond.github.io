# About Me <i class="fa-solid fa-seedling" style="color: #6aac96;"></i>

I graduated from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara with a Master of Environmental Science and Management. At Bren, I specialized in Conservation Planning and Strategic Environmental Communications, combining my love of environmental science with the ability to share it with diverse audiences.

I also hold a B.S. in Molecular Environmental Biology from UC Berkeley, where I studied how global environmental change is impacting organisms, ecosystems, and human well-being. I have professional experience working as a research assistant, a teacher, and an environmental analyst.

Though I've spent a number of years living in California, and one in Spain, I was raised in Massachusetts and that's where I call home. In my free time, I love exploring the outdoors, trying new restaurants, running, and traveling.
