    "section": "What Can We Do?",
    "text": "What Can We Do?\nForest restoration describes a set of practices that seek to return a forest to a healthier, more resilient state. This involves removing excess trees and vegetation that are making the forest overcrowded and stressed. Just like how weeding a garden helps give plants the space and resources they need to thrive, forest restoration aims to “open up” the forest floor and promote healthy growth.\nWith this in mind, those in charge of managing a forest may choose from a few different options:\n\nPrescribed burning, or the controlled application of fire to the landscape.\nMechanical thinning, or the removal of trees and other vegetation using forestry equipment.\nCombining prescribed fire and mechanical thinning. Mechanically thin the forest first, and then conduct a prescribed burn.\n\nFor this project, I sought to answer the questions:\nHow well do these different forest restoration treatments actually work? Can they reduce overcrowding in our forests, decrease the likelihood of severe wildfire, AND protect the carbon that forests naturally sequester?\nAny restoration practice that could achieve all three of these goals would be extremely valuable for future forest restoration efforts.\n\nAbout the Data\nTo explore these questions further, I used data that were collected and made available by a team of researchers from UC Berkeley (go Bears!). In their paper, Forest restoration and fuels reduction work: Different pathways for achieving success in the Sierra Nevada, Dr Scott Stephens and his team show how all three of these forest restoration practices can be successful over the long term.\nThis paper presented the results of a long-term ecological research study on the impacts of different fuels treatment and forest restoration strategies in the Sierra Nevada. Plots in an experimental forest were randomly assigned to one of four different treatment options: prescribed fire, mechanical thinning, combined fire and mechanical thinning, and no treatment (control). Data collection occurred over a period of 18 years. The scientists measured vegetation characteristics, fuel amounts, and tree stand densities. They also conducted fire modeling to calculate the probability of torching (essentially, fire so severe that it scorches even the tops of trees) and the probability of tree mortality in each plot. Alongside this information, the data contains variables describing the treatment used, the plot ID number, the year, and whether the data were collected pre- or post-treatment.\nAs an ecologist and environmental scientist, I loved reading this paper. But for those who are less inclined to pore over academic writing, never fear! I translated their results into the infographic below to highlight the main findings that I found exciting."

    "text": "Data Visualization as Science Communication\n\nFinal Infographic\n\n\n\nInfographic showing the benefits and relative strengths of different forest restoration practices.\n\n\nThis infographic is made up of three individual plots that I created in R, then stitched together using Affinity Designer. Next, I’ll walk you through the steps I took to put this infographic together.\n\n\nSet Up\nHere I load the libraries I need, set up my color palette, load in custom fonts, and load in my data. Throughout this blog post, you can click to expand the code chunks for each individual step as you’d like.\n\n\nCode\n# ..........load libraries.........\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(paletteer)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n#.........enable {showtext} for rendering...........\nshowtext_auto()\nshowtext_opts(dpi = 300)\n\n# ........set color palette.........\nconifer &lt;- paletteer_d(\"calecopal::conifer\", n = 5)\n# subset individual colors from palette\ntreatments &lt;- c(\"Combined Thinning and Prescribed Fire\" = \"#979A6BFF\", \n                \"Prescribed Fire\" = \"#CC7540FF\", \n                \"Mechanical Thinning\" = \"#39692FFF\", \n                \"Control\" = \"#765043FF\")\n\n# ........add custom fonts.........\nfont_add_google(name = \"Montserrat\", family = \"montserrat\")\nfont_add_google(name = \"Work Sans\", family = \"work sans\")\n\n\n# ..........load data files.........\n# part A: stand density index\n  # stand density index (SDI)\n  sdi_data &lt;- read_csv(here(\"posts\", \"2025-03-11-forest-restoration\", \"data\", \"sdi_data.csv\")) \n\n# part B: fire risk\n  # ptorch\n  ptorch_data &lt;- read_csv(here(\"posts\", \"2025-03-11-forest-restoration\", \"data\", \"ptorch_data.csv\"))\n  \n# part C: stable live tree carbon\n  # stable live tree carbon (STLC)\n  stlc_data &lt;- read_csv(here(\"posts\", \"2025-03-11-forest-restoration\", \"data\", \"sltc_data.csv\"))\n\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\nI made sure to wrangle my data before making any plots. As the researchers had already cleaned the data prior to sharing it with the public, this step was fairly simple. I mainly had to convert my treatment variables to factors so that I could treat each restoration practice as a discrete category.

Reducing tree densities helps protect a forest against the impacts of drought, pests, and disease.\nI created a lollipop chart showing the proportion of the forest that was considered “extremely high density” within each restoration practice. It is then possible to compare the amount of high density forest that results from each restoration option.\n\n\nCode\n# Process the data to calculate % of plots, for that treatment, in each SDI zone\ndensity_plot &lt;- sdi_clean %&gt;%\n  \n  # first, count number of plots in each treatment type and SDI benchmark zone\n  group_by(treatment, sdi_zone_long) %&gt;%\n  summarize(count_treatment_zone = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  \n  # second, add the counts to get the total number of plots in each treatment type\n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;% \n  mutate(count_treatment = sum(count_treatment_zone),\n         \n         # third, divide the number of plots per SDI zone by the number of total plots for that treatment \n         pct_zone_per_treatment = count_treatment_zone/count_treatment) %&gt;% \n  \n  # filter to only extremely high density plots\n  filter(sdi_zone_long == \"Extremely High\") %&gt;% \n  \n  # set up ggplot\n  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = pct_zone_per_treatment, color = treatment)) +\n  \n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  \n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = pct_zone_per_treatment), \n                 alpha = 0.5,\n                 linewidth = 2) +\n\n  # wrap long labels\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap(20)) +\n  \n  # add y axis limits\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.75)) +\n  \n  # add colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = treatments) +\n  \n  # add title, subtitle, and y axis label\n  labs(title = \"Decrease Dangerously High Density\",\n       subtitle = \"Without restoration, most of the forest is overcrowded and faces\\na greater risk of death and disease\",\n       caption = \"Data from Stephens et al. 2023.\",\n       y = \"Percent of Plots\") +\n  \n  # add percent labels to each line\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(pct_zone_per_treatment, \n                                        scale = 100,\n                                        accuracy = 1)), \n            hjust = -0.35, \n            vjust = -0.35,\n            size = 5,\n            family = \"work sans\") +\n  \n  # apply themeing\n  theme(\n    # remove legend\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    # remove axis titles and axes themselves\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    #adjust title, subtitle, axis text\n    plot.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\",\n                              face = \"bold\",\n                              size = 16,\n                              hjust = 0,\n                              margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                                 size = 14,\n                                 hjust = 0,\n                                 margin = margin(0, 0, 10, 0)),\n    axis.text = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                             size = 14),\n    # adjust caption\n    plot.caption = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                                face = \"italic\", \n                                color = \"#484848\",\n                                size = 11,\n                                hjust = 1,\n                                margin = margin(20, 0, 10, 0))\n  )\ndensity_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWildfire Ridgeline Plot\nMy second figure answers the question:\nWhich restoration practices are best at reducing the risk of severe fire?\nI created a ridgeline plot to visualize the distribution of ptorch values for each restoration practices. Remember that the probability of torching essentially represents the probability of that forest experiencing a severe wildfire (if a fire were to burn, would it be severe?). The median values are marked by vertical lines within the ridges, and the individual points, representing individual forest plots, are shown in a “raincloud” formation below each ridge.\n\n\nCode\nfire_plot &lt;- ptorch_clean %&gt;% \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = ptorch, y = treatment, fill = treatment)) +\n  # create rideline plot with raincloud of points underneath. use quantile line to mark median value\n  geom_density_ridges(aes(point_color = treatment),\n                               scale = 0.8, alpha = 0.8,\n                               rel_min_height = 0.02,\n                               jittered_points = TRUE, \n                               quantile_lines = TRUE, \n                               linewidth = 0.8,\n                               vline_width = 0.8, vline_color = \"black\",\n                               point_size = 0.4, point_alpha = 0.6, \n                               position = \"raincloud\",\n                               quantiles = 2) +\n  \n  # wrap long labels on y axis\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = label_wrap(20)) +\n  \n  # apply fill colors\n  scale_fill_manual(values = treatments) +\n  \n  # apply point colors\n  scale_discrete_manual(\"point_color\", values = treatments) +\n  \n  # add title and axis label\n  labs(title = \"Reduce Risk of Severe Wildfire\",\n       subtitle = \"Without restoration, forests face a much greater risk of severe wildfire\",\n       caption = \"Data from Stephens et al. 2023.\",\n       x = \"Probability of Severe Wildfire\") +\n  # add percent labels\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  \n  # add themeing\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    # remove legend and y axis title\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    \n    #adjust title, subtitle, axis text\n    plot.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\",\n                              face = \"bold\", \n                              size = 16,\n                              hjust = 1,\n                              margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                                 size = 14,\n                                 hjust = 1,\n                                 margin = margin(0, 0, 15, 0)),\n    axis.text = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                             size = 12,\n                             margin = margin(10, 0, 0, 0)),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                                face = \"bold\",\n                                color = \"#484848\",\n                                size = 14,\n                                margin = margin(15, 0, 0, 0)),\n    \n    # adjust caption\n    plot.caption = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                                face = \"italic\", \n                                color = \"#484848\",\n                                size = 11,\n                                hjust = 1,\n                                margin = margin(20, 0, 10, 0))\n    )\nfire_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForest Carbon Slope Chart\nMy third and final figure answers the question:\nWhich restoration practices are best at protecting forest carbon stocks?\nTo answer this, I created a slope chart showing the carbon stored by forests under each restoration treatment. I wanted to show how the carbon stored would decrease after a wildfire went through. This connects to the wildfire chart above, as severe wildfire will release more carbon to the atmosphere than low-intensity wildfire. Note that these carbon values are averages, and that they represent on the carbon stored by live trees, and not any carbon stored in the soil belowground or in other types of vegetation.\n\n\nCode\n# first, calculate the mean stlc and mean existing carbon for each treatment type\ncarbon_plot &lt;- stlc_clean %&gt;% \n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;% \n  summarize(mean_carbon_mgha = mean(carbon_mgha),\n            mean_stable_ltc_mgha = mean(stable_ltc_mgha)) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(mean_carbon_mgha:mean_stable_ltc_mgha,\n               names_to = \"carbon_type\",\n               values_to = \"carbon_mgha\") %&gt;% \n  \n  # now create slope chart\n  ggplot(aes(x = carbon_type, y = carbon_mgha, color = treatment, group = treatment)) +\n  # add vertical lines as background\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, color = \"lightgray\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, color = \"lightgray\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  \n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  # add lines connecting the points\n  geom_line() +\n  \n  # add number labels to each line (showing carbon in mg/ha)\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(carbon_mgha, 0)), \n            hjust = -0.2, \n            vjust = -0.2,\n            size = 4.5,\n            family = \"work sans\") +\n  \n  # add annotations to label each line with the treatment group name\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = 0.88, y = 228,\n    size = 14 / .pt,\n    label = \"Control\",\n    color = \"#765043FF\") +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = 0.78, y = 170,\n    size = 14 / .pt,\n    label = \"Prescribed Fire\",\n    color = \"#CC7540FF\") +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = 0.7, y = 164,\n    size = 14 / .pt,\n    label = \"Mechanical Thinning\",\n    color = \"#39692FFF\") +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = 0.7, y = 126,\n    size = 14 / .pt,\n    label = \"Combined Thinning\\nand Prescribed Fire\",\n    color = \"#979A6BFF\") +\n  \n  # apply color palette based upon treatment\n  scale_color_manual(values = treatments) +\n  \n  # change x axis labels\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"Pre-Fire\", \"Post-Fire\")) +\n  \n  labs(title = \"Preserve Forest Carbon Stocks\",\n       subtitle = \"Unrestored forests risk losing a large amount\\nof their stored carbon\",\n       caption = \"Data from Stephens et al. 2023.\") +\n\n  theme(\n    # remove legend, gridlines, axis lines, axis titles\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    #adjust title, subtitle, and axis text\n    plot.title.position = \"panel\",\n    plot.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\",\n                              face = \"bold\", \n                              hjust = 0,\n                              size = 16,\n                              margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                                 size = 14,\n                                 hjust = 0,\n                                 margin = margin(0, 0, 20, 0)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                               face = \"bold\",\n                               color = \"#484848\",\n                               size = 14,\n                               margin = margin(10, 0, 0, 0)),\n    # adjust caption\n    plot.caption = element_text(family = \"work sans\",\n                                face = \"italic\", \n                                color = \"#484848\",\n                                size = 12,\n                                hjust = 0.7,\n                                margin = margin(20, 0, 10, 0))\n  )\ncarbon_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it All Together\nTo create the final infographic, I saved each plot I made and combined them using Affinity Designer, a vector graphic design software akin to Adobe Illustrator. I used this software to add additional graphics and annotations, including visual depictions of some of the forest ecology concepts I describe (such as forest density and carbon loss). I also made small aesthetic tweaks to font sizes, colors, and fontface as needed.\n\n\nDesign Elements\nIt is essential to explicitly consider different design elements when creating an infographic. I wanted my visualizations to tie in to each other and tell a clear story. So, I wanted to explain my thinking and the rationale behind my choices for each of the ten essential design elements listed below. If you are planning to create your own infographic, make sure you keep these in mind!\n\nGraphic FormTextThemesColorsTypographyGeneral DesignData ContextMessageAccessibilityDEI\n\n\nGraphic Form: I used three different graphic forms for my plots: a lollipop chart, a ridgeline plot, and a slope chart. I wanted to use a variety of charts, and pick some that were slightly out of the ordinary, but still keep them simple and effective. I felt like the lollipop chart was essentially a fun spin on a bar chart, and would be very easy to read and understand the message of. The slope chart idea came to me after I first played around with some dumbbell plots but didn’t quite like the look of them. I like how the slope chart shows the “change in time”, in a way, on the x axis, and the “change in amount” on the y axis. After making those two charts, I knew I wanted my wildfire chart to have minimal straight lines so that it would be visually different from the other two. I tried boxplot and violin charts before finally settling on the ridgeline design. I liked that I could still show the median value, and the density of the data in two ways (through the ridgeline and the raincloud of points below).\n\n\nText: In each of my stand alone plots, I included a title, subtitle, caption, and axis text and labels where appropriate. I removed any legends and axis text that I could in order to simplify the design. When I combined the plots together in the infographic, I further moved and removed text wherever possible. For instance, I changed all of the subtitles to be annotations on the plots, and I removed the restoration practices axis text and replaced them with the corresponding icons. I also removed the individual data credit captions, and replaced them with one single caption at the bottom right of the infographic. I did this to reduce the reading burden on a viewer, and to make sure the text I did need to include would be that much more attention grabbing. I also added small diagrams and additional text boxes to describe aspects of forest ecology that were essential to a viewer’s understanding of the concepts captured by the data.\n\n\nThemes: I chose to keep plot themes simple and minimal as much as possible. This included removing legends and axis text, as mentioned above, as well as axis lines and background grids. I found that most of these elements were not necessary to convey meaning, and could often be replaced by just adding numerical labels onto the plot itself. Similarly, I wanted the overall theme of the infographic to be simple, neutral and earthy. I used a very light shade of brown for the background, slightly darker shades of brown to highlight some regions of text, and kept additional forest graphics as black silhouettes.\n\n\nColors: I used colors from the calecopal package, specifically from the conifer palette. This palette was created to mimic the natural colors found in California conifer forests, so it was an ideal fit for the subject matter of my visualizations. I picked four distinct colors from this palette so that they would be easily distinguishable. I decided to use color only to differentiate between the different restoration practices. Since I knew each of my visualizations would contain all four practices, I felt that the use of color would make it easier for a viewer to interpret these graphs separately and view them all together. In effect, the consistent use of colors helps my audience follow the thread of the story throughout my infographic.\n\n\nTypography: I chose to use two fonts throughout my infographic. Montserrat I used for the main title and the title of each plot. All other text was displayed using Work Sans. These fonts are both sans serif, which aids their readability on a screen. I also chose them because they were simple, calm, and composed. Beyond these fonts, I also chose to use italics and bolding to emphasize or de-emphasize certain text. For instance, I italicized the author and data attributions at the bottom of the infographic so that they would not be overly eye-catching. I used bolding in some of my annotations, along with color, to draw attention to the specific restoration practice that I was talking about.\n\n\nGeneral Design: I wanted the viewer’s eyes to generally move from the top to the bottom of the visualization. I presented the title, background, and icons for each restoration practice up at the very top of the page, so that they would be viewed first. I then started with the forest density plot in the top left, moved towards the wildfire plot in the middle right, and ended with the carbon stocks plot on the bottom left. I wanted viewers to be able to connect these ideas to each other: forests with high densities of trees are more susceptible to severe fire (among other threats). Forests at risk of severe fire are more likely to lose a greater amount of their stored carbon, because of the loss of more trees. I provided small graphics to illustrate these concepts in the top right and bottom right of the infographic. I tried to keep enough spacing between figures, text, and other graphics so that it would not feel too crowded. And while I generally wanted the viewer’s eyes to move downwards, zigzagging through the infographic, I didn’t want to overly prescribe this path by using too many arrows or by numbering the different plots. Instead, I hope I struck a balance between giving them a general direction to read through, and giving them room to explore and move between pieces of information as they wish.\n\n\nContextualizing Data: I contextualized the data in both the header, the forestry graphics, and the plot annotations. I spent a lot of time throughout this project figuring out how to simplify these forest ecology concepts and remove jargon so that it would be understandable to a broader audience. Some words, such as “forest density” and “carbon” were just too essential to the story to be removed, so these I clarified through the use of my drawings and text blurbs. I also used the annotations on the plots themselves to pull out the main points for the viewer.\n\n\nCentering Primary Message: My primary message was that any of these restoration practices would produce significantly better outcomes than taking no action. Yes, there was also some nuance and tradeoffs between the different practices, some of which I pointed out. But in general, I wanted a viewer to understand that restoration is necessary and that this is why: it helps decrease forest densities, it helps reduce severe wildfires, and it helps store more stable carbon. To make this point clear, I made sure that the title of each plot captured that takeaway, in short and concise wording. I also made an annotation on each plot describing how poorly the “no restoration” option performed. I did all of this in combination with simply framing the message with my title, which highlights the “benefits of forest restoration”.\n\n\nConsidering Accessibility: As mentioned above, I wanted to use colors from the conifer palette to represent the conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada. The colors I chose are distinguishable to those with “normal” color vision but harder to tell apart for those with color blindness. This is because they fall within the orange, green, and brown parts of the spectrum, which are less easily distinguished by people with red-green color blindness. To balance the use of these colors with accessibility concerns, I made sure my labeling was redundant of my color choices. I did this by including the icons describing each restoration practice on all three of my plots, in conjunction with the colors. That way, even someone who perceives the colors differently from myself can identify the practices based on the unique icons and the key for each that I included in the heading.\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): DEI is essential to consider for any data that depicts people, places, and communities. However, I did not end up incorporating a DEI lens into this piece of work because of the nature of my data. This data solely described physical characteristics of forests, and did not address any aspect of the people who may be nearby or involved in their management. Thus, there was not a DEI context to consider in this instance, but I would urge you to always consider whether DEI needs to be included in your own visualizations!"

    "title": "Suitable Lion Habitat May Shift with Climate Change",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nFrom 1900-2022, atmospheric carbon has climbed from 8.54 to 53.85 billion tons (Jones et al. 2024). While we can model previous carbon emissions, predicting future emissions regimes, alongside societal change and economic development, divides scholars. Each possible scenario, which ranges from overly pessimistic (high difficulty mitigating emissions) to overly optimistic (low difficulty mitigating emissions), will affect species to varying degrees.\nProblem\nClimate change and socioeconomic development will affect future environmental conditions and African lion range. We sought to understand the distribution of future suitable habitat for lions, considering two climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) to encompass a range of possible future conditions.\nApproach\nTo understand this problem, we utilized Maxent through the interactive web interface Wallace. Maxent utilizes species occurrence data input by the user as well as climate data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) to find the current range of suitable habitats for a specific species. It then allows the user to input a desired future timeframe and climate scenario to visualize changes in range over time. For this project, all other variables were held constant except the climate scenario (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) to compare the differences in suitable habitat accurately. Once the analysis was performed for each scenario, the original and future maps were exported as TIF files and input into ArcGIS Pro. Using Raster Calculator, the values of the future map were subtracted from the original to yield a layer describing the change in habitat suitability between the two.\nResults\n\n\n\nFigure 1. African lion habitat suitability. Percent change in habitat suitability for African lions (Panthera leo) from present day to 2041-60 under SSP1-2.6 (A) and SSP5-8.5 (B).\n\n\nThe final analysis produced two maps (Figure 1) showing the percentage change for African Lion habitats between the two climate scenarios. Visual assessment provided the following results:\n●      Western Africa was more suitable for African lions in SSP1-2.6 compared to SSP5-8.5\n●      Southern Africa was more suitable for African Lions in SSP5-8.5 compared to SSP1-2.6\n●      Regions in Central Africa that became more suitable for African Lions in SSP1-2.6 became less suitable for lions in SSP5-8.5\nConclusion\nThe areas characterized by a negative change in habitat suitability values, shown in dark green on the map, should be prioritized for conservation. In effect, these areas are predicted to become increasingly suitable for lions in the future (henceforth these areas are referred to as “future suitable habitat”). It would be useful to compare the locations of future suitable habitat with existing nature reserves and protected areas to assess what degree of protection is already given to them, and whether there are key areas missing that would benefit from greater protections. Given the uncertainty over which SSP scenario will best match reality, managers may also want to prioritize conservation of future suitable habitat, especially where the areas overlap between the two SSP scenarios.\nIf lions shift their ranges to occupy new areas, it is worth considering the impact that may have on people living in those areas, especially if they are not accustomed to living near lions. While a charismatic and widely-regarded species, lions are also potentially dangerous to livestock and humans (Mills et al., 2023). To minimize human-wildlife conflict in a changing world, wildlife managers may want to consider proactively planning for human-lion coexistence in those communities based upon existing successful strategies (Blackburn et al., 2016).\nCitations\nBlackburn, S., Hopcraft, J.

    "title": "Kudzu Invasions May Expand Northwards",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Kudzu (Pueraria montana) is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia which has become invasive in the United States. It is able to grow extremely quickly and outcompete native vegetation. This exacts an ecological and economic toll, particularly on timber forests which suffer productivity losses due to kudzu growth (Herron et al., 2020). Currently found across much of the southeastern U.S., kudzu may continue to spread north and west as climate change creates more favorable environmental conditions (“Kudzu: The Invasive Vine That Ate the South,” 2019).\nProblem: Given the ecologically and economically taxing impact of Kudzu on forest productivity and native biodiversity, it is important to identify areas that should be restored in the face of climate change. Utilizing species distribution models can inform how Kudzu will spread under certain climate scenarios and what areas restoration projects should be planned for.\nApproach: We used Maxent within the R package Wallace to create species distribution models (SDMs) of kudzu in the present day and under future climate-and-socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs). We obtained 10,000 occurrence points from GBIF for kudzu, then selected down to only those points within the contiguous United States (~5,000) and spatially partitioned them into four groups for model training. We selected a variety of WorldClim Bioclim variables (Table 1) for precipitation and temperature based upon a brief review of relevant literature and knowledge of kudzu’s ecological niche (Callen & Miller, 2015; Kovach-Hammons et al., 2023). We extracted this data from 10,000 background points within a 5 degree buffer of our occurrence points. We used the Maxent algorithm to model current habitat suitability for kudzu, setting linear and quadratic feature classes to account for linear and non-linear relationships. We set the regularization parameter as 1.5 to avoid over-fitting our model and to determine a simpler complexity. Clamping was set as ‘true’ to constrain our variables within the focal range and parallel processing was set as ‘false.’ Using the MIROC6 climate model, we then transferred our model to a future scenario of moderate climate-and-socioeconomic change (SSP 370) for the years 2041-2060.\nIn ArcGIS Pro, we processed our SDMs along with the 2019 NLCD data (30m resolution, contiguous U.S.) to find forested areas that overlapped with current and predicted kudzu presence. We used the SDMs for the present day, and for SSP 370 in 2041-2060. We ensured all our data layers were in the Albers equal-area conic projection to preserve area for our calculations, and resampled our data to a 1km resolution for faster processing time. We reclassified and isolated just the forested areas from NLCD (encompassing deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests) and intersected these with areas of kudzu presence (defined as SDM probabilities &gt; 50%).\nResults: We found a total forested area of 496,114 km2 was currently at risk of kudzu occupation, mainly across the southeastern U.S. (Figure 1). The area between Charlotte, NC and Knoxville, TN is particularly concentrated with current suitable forest habitat for kudzu. In 2041-2060 under SSP 370, we found that a forested area of 555,508 km2 would be at risk of kudzu occupation (Figure 2). While still mainly predicted to be within the southeastern U.S., kudzu may also be found as far north as Pittsburgh and Boston in this future scenario.\nConclusion: Estimated to cost greater than $500 million annually in damages and loss of forest productivity, kudzu is expected to spread and cause increases in economic losses under climate change (Blaustein, 2001). Due to kudzu’s significant economic and ecological impact on forests in the southeastern U.S., it is necessary to identify suitable areas under climate change scenarios to target invasive species mitigation strategically. The northward spread of kudzu highlights opportunities to integrate invasive species prevention measures in northern areas while also highlighting restoration opportunities in regions that are deemed to be no longer suitable for kudzu under future climate change. Restoration and prevention measures will be costly, and given the economic toll kudzu has already enacted on forest ecosystems, it will require proper prioritization, communication, and stakeholder engagement to successfully complete these types of projects.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Current Suitable Forest Habitat For Kudzu. Forested areas of the southeastern United States that are currently suitable habitat for kudzu are shown in green. All other forested areas are shown in gray.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Projected Suitable Forest Habitat for Kudzu.

    "title": "Raptors are Effective Umbrella Species for Conservation Prioritization",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Raptors and other umbrella species are commonly used in designing reserve networks for biodiversity conservation. Protecting raptors helps safeguard many other species within the same ecosystem. In Morro Bay, creating reserve networks involves balancing various conservation strategies to optimize both ecological and socioeconomic factors. Designing reserve networks based on umbrella species protections can be a cost effective way to achieve conservation goals.\nProblem: Creating a network of reserves in Morro Bay requires consideration of species richness, abundance, and distribution, the costs of land conservation, and the spatial configuration of the network. Optimizing all of these factors is computationally expensive and requires setting numerous species-specific conservation targets. We were interested in assessing the optimal reserve designs when all species (for which we had data) were taken into account, and comparing it with the optimal designs for birds of prey. The level of similarity between the two may indicate whether it is possible to use raptors as umbrella species for reserve design, reducing the need for intensive data collection across many different taxa.\nApproach: Our approach had two components: 1) designing an optimal reserve network for all species, and 2) designing an optimal reserve network for birds of prey. The all-species reserve design included 140 species across a wide array of taxa. The birds of prey reserve design included eight (8) species of raptor: the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum), Cooper’s hawk (Accipiter cooperii), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), merlin (Falco columbarius), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), and the sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus).\nWe used the prioritizr package in R to conduct our analyses and focused on solving Marxan problems, which optimize actions to achieve species conservation targets at the least cost. We used our data on species conservation targets, land planning unit costs, and each species’ presence in each planning unit to set up the initial Marxan problem. We wanted to calculate the optimal reserve design (optimality gap of 0%), as well as a portfolio of 100 reserve design possibilities that were within a small margin of optimal (optimality gap of 15%), so we ran two calculations with these different parameters. To solve the problems once the additional parameters were specified, we used the gurobi solver. In addition, for the portfolio of reserve solutions, we calculated the number of times each planning unit was selected for inclusion in the reserve, representing the frequency of selection and thus the level of priority for conservation of each unit. These analysis steps were conducted for all species first, and then repeated with the selected birds of prey species.\nResults: As shown in Figure 1, the high priority conservation areas (dark blue) for all 140 studied species (panel A) and for the 8 raptors species (panel B) are nearly geographically identical. There are minor differences across low, moderate, and non-priority areas. Nonetheless, Figure 1 conveys that raptors have a similar optimal reserve network when compared to all studied species. When designing reserve networks based on a single optimal solution, as displayed in Figure 2, conservation priority areas across all species (panel A) and for raptors alone (panel B) are nearly identical.\nConclusions: Given the similarities between the optimal reserve networks for all studied species and the raptor species, our results suggest that raptors can be used as an umbrella species for Morro Bay reserve design. Utilizing raptors as an umbrella species can reduce the need for intensive data collection across many different taxa and can ultimately achieve the same conservation goals for all species. This conservation strategy will minimize costs and workload while maintaining an adequate level of protection for all studied species. This method of reserve design can create ambiguity for the protection of rare and/or threatened species (such as the California red-legged frog) and may require additional, more specialized protections for these species with unique habitat requirements. Overall, umbrella species can be a cost-effective strategy to optimize conservation efforts in Morro Bay.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Priority conservation areas in Morro Bay. Land planning units of conservation interest for all studied species (A) and for raptors (B). Each planning unit is color-coded by conservation priority, ranging from non-priority (selected 0 times by optimization algorithm), low priority (selected once), moderate priority (selected 2 or more times), and high priority (selected every time).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "title": "Jaguar Habitat Connectivity is Threatened by Anthropogenic Land Uses",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a species of big cat found in habitats ranging from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina. They are threatened by the loss and fragmentation of their habitat, along with illegal wildlife trade, illegal trophy hunting, and conflict with humans (USFWS). In Costa Rica, jaguar habitat is protected in nature reserves, but jaguars are not confined to those areas and may move across the landscape to meet their various needs.\nProblem: Identifying key jaguar movement corridors and high-trafficked pinch points will help reserve managers better understand barriers to movement and interactions between the reserves. Connectivity between the reserves is crucial to ensure interbreeding across different jaguar populations. As a threatened species, jaguar connectivity between reserves will ensure species stability and longevity.\nApproach: We used Circuitscape and ArcGIS Pro to analyze jaguar movement in the Talamanca-Osa region of Costa Rica across three conservation reserves: Corcovado, Piedras Blancas, and La Amistad National Parks. These three reserves serve as core areas of jaguar habitat with low levels of human modification. Folger and Brock created a resistance layer (resolution of 390m) by combining features from many data layers including roads, elevation, and land cover and by assigning weighted resistance values to these features based on expert opinion, available data, and literature review. Jaguar least-cost corridors, least-coast pathways, and key movement pinch points between the three reserves were modeled and mapped using Circuitscape.\nTo identify key jaguar corridors and the least cost pathway between the three reserves, we created a map of cost-weighted distances to the three core areas, with a corridor width of 20 cost-weighted km. We visualized the corridors by classifying into 20 quantiles of cost-weighted distances. The least-cost pathway between each pair of reserves was mapped to represent the “best” route for jaguars to take, accounting for both distance traveled and the resistance values of the landscape. To identify key pinch points within corridor areas, we ran Circuitscape across the corridor areas from the previous step. This output displayed areas where corridors are constricted and jaguar movement is funneled through those zones.\nResults: Figure 1 illustrates movement pinch points between Corcovado, Piedras Blancas, and La Amistad National Parks. There is a greater number of pinch points between Corcovado and Piedras Blancas than between Piedras Blancas and La Amistad. Corridors and least-cost pathways between reserves are shown in Figure 2. Between Corcovado and Piedras Blancas, the least-cost pathway makes a slight northward arc. Between Piedras Blancas and La Amistad, the least-cost pathway is a fairly straight line, with slight deviations to either side.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Jaguar Corridor Pinch Points. Movement pathways of jaguars across three conservation reserves: Corcovado, Piedras Blancas, and La Amistad National Parks. Increased pinch points between Corcovado and Piedras Blancas in comparison to Piedras Blancas and La Amistad.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Jaguar movement corridors and least-cost pathways. Movement corridors between Corcovado, Piedras Blancas, and La Amistad National Parks color-coded by cost-weighted distance (lighter = lower cost, darker = higher cost). The least-cost pathway between each pair of reserves is overlaid as a black line.\n\n\nConclusions: The many movement pinch points between Corcovado and Piedras Blancas represent areas that may be critical for jaguar movement. Development or land conversion in those areas could threaten the ability of jaguars to disperse between the two parks. The pinch points that intersect with the least-cost pathway may be particularly high-trafficked areas by jaguars. If jaguars are funneled through a narrow corridor, that puts them more at risk of coming into contact with each other and potentially causing territorial conflicts (USFWS). Similarly, there may be a high risk of human-jaguar conflict along the least-cost path. Managers should prioritize the maintenance of connectivity between the two reserves, as well as consider protecting other movement corridors to reduce the severity of pinch points.\nBetween Piedras Blancas and La Amistad, there are very few pinch points. This indicates that there is homogeneity in the habitat quality between those two areas, with no particular pathway being easier for a jaguar to take. It does not indicate whether or not that habitat is suitable for jaguars to move through, but we can assume that it is of poor quality, given the background information that jaguars are not frequently observed to move between those two parks. Thus it should be a priority to increase connectivity between those two reserves to ensure long-term jaguar population viability.\nIn future research, it could be beneficial to use collar tracking or camera trap data to map pathways that jaguars actually use, and compare these to the simulated least-cost paths, to create a better-informed picture of jaguar movement between the reserves.\nCitations:\nUSFWS.

    "text": "Overview\nThis dataset describes the survival and growth of two species of palmetto (Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia), as measured at Archbold Biological Station in Florida. Both species are types of fan palm. The scientists studying these species measured plant height, canopy length and width, number of green leaves, and other characteristics of the plants’ growth. Data were collected annually from 1981 - 1997, and then again in 2001 and in 2017.\nThe purpose of this analysis is to test whether measurements of height, canopy length, canopy width, and number of green leaves can be used to classify whether an unknown plant is a member of S. repens or S. etonia.

To be good predictors, there should be notable differences in these values between the species. I decided to explore these four variables using boxplots.\n\n\nCode\nheight_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = p_clean) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as_factor(species), y = height), fill = \"olivedrab3\", color = \"olivedrab\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"1\" = \"S. repens\", \"2\" = \"S. etonia\")) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Height (cm)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"italic\"))\n\nwidth_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = p_clean) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as_factor(species), y = width), fill = \"olivedrab3\", color = \"olivedrab\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"1\" = \"S. repens\", \"2\" = \"S. etonia\")) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Width (cm)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"italic\"))\n\nlength_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = p_clean) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as_factor(species), y = length), fill = \"olivedrab3\", color = \"olivedrab\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"1\" = \"S. repens\", \"2\" = \"S. etonia\")) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Length (cm)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"italic\"))\n\nleaves_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = p_clean) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as_factor(species), y = green_lvs), fill = \"olivedrab3\", color = \"olivedrab\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"1\" = \"S. repens\", \"2\" = \"S. etonia\")) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Number of Green Leaves\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"italic\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_grid(height_plot, width_plot, length_plot, leaves_plot,\n          labels = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n          ncol = 2,\n          vjust = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Boxplots comparing height, width, length, and number of green leaves for S. repens and S. etonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways:\nPlant heights between the two species look fairly similar, so height may not be a good predictor of species. There may be some difference in plant widths, and even more noticeable differences in length and number of green leaves. I expect length and green leaves to be especially important predictors, since they seem to show the largest differences between species.\n\n\nBinary Logistic Regression Models\n\nCreate formulas\nI am interested in comparing two models. One model predicts species based on height, length, width, and green leaves (Model 1). The other model predicts species based only on height, width, and green leaves (Model 2). The difference between the two is whether length is used as a predictor variable.\n\n\nCode\n# model 1\nf1 &lt;- species ~ height + length + width + green_lvs\n# model 2\nf2 &lt;- species ~ height + width + green_lvs\n\n\n\n\nTen-Fold Cross Validation\nNow that the two model formulas are defined, it is time to see which performs better at classification. I decided to use ten-fold cross validation to repeatedly fit the models to ten different subsets of the data, and then I extracted the average performance metrics from each model.\n\n\nCode\n# create folded version of dataset\nset.seed(10101)\np_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(p_clean, v = 10, repeats = 10)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# set up model\nblr_mdl &lt;- logistic_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine('glm')\n\n# create workflows\nblr_wf_1 &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_model(blr_mdl) %&gt;% \n  add_formula(f1) \n\nblr_wf_2 &lt;- workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_model(blr_mdl) %&gt;% \n  add_formula(f2)\n\n# apply the workflows to the folded data\nblr_fit_folds_1 &lt;- blr_wf_1 %&gt;% \n  fit_resamples(p_folds)\nblr_fit_folds_2 &lt;- blr_wf_2 %&gt;% \n  fit_resamples(p_folds)\n\n\n\n\nCross Validation Results\n\n\nCode\ncollect_metrics(blr_fit_folds_1) %&gt;% \n  select(-.config) %&gt;% \n  rename(metric = .metric,\n         estimator = .estimator,\n         standard_error = std_err) %&gt;% \n  kbl() %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(\"basic\", position = \"center\")\ncollect_metrics(blr_fit_folds_2) %&gt;% \n  select(-.config) %&gt;% \n  rename(metric = .metric,\n         estimator = .estimator,\n         standard_error = std_err) %&gt;% \n  kbl() %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(\"basic\", position = \"center\")\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Comparing the predictive performance of the two models.

Model 1 has a greater area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve than Model 2 has (0.9725 compared with 0.9635). The model with a greater area under the curve is the better classifier. In addition, Model 1 had a slightly higher accuracy rate than Model 2 (91.7% compared with 89.9%). Though Model 1 ended up winning based on area under the curve and accuracy, it is worth noting that both models performed very well.\n\n\n\nTrain Selected Model\nI next trained Model 1 using the entire dataset (without any folding) to obtain my final coefficient results for each predictor variable (shown in the “estimate” column of the table below).\n\n\nCode\n## run model on entire dataset\nblr1_fit &lt;- blr_mdl %&gt;% \n  fit(formula = f1, data = p_clean)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# create table with blr results\nbroom::tidy(blr1_fit) %&gt;% \n  select(-statistic) %&gt;% \n  kbl() %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(\"basic\", position = \"center\")\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Final Model 1 results.

I generated predicted species classifications for each observed set of plant height, width, length, and green leaves in the dataset, then compared these predictions to the actual species identities. Predictions were made using a 50% cutoff, meaning that a species was classified as species 1 if the probability of it being species 1, based on my Model 1 results, was 50% or greater.\n\n\nCode\n# generate predictions\np_predict &lt;- p_clean %&gt;% \n  mutate(predict(blr1_fit, new_data = .)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(predict(blr1_fit, new_data = ., type = 'prob'))\n\n# make table of prediction results\npredict_table &lt;- table(p_predict %&gt;%\n        select(species, .pred_class))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nkbl(data.frame(\n  species = c(\"1\", \"2\"),\n  n_correct = c(5548, 5701),\n  n_incorrect = c(564, 454)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(p_correct = n_correct/(n_correct+n_incorrect))) %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(\"basic\", position = \"center\")\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Model 1 predictions.

The leftmost column depicts the percent of predictions that were correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nn_correct\nn_incorrect\np_correct\n\n\n\n\n1\n5548\n564\n0.9077225\n\n\n2\n5701\n454\n0.9262388\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nMy fitted Model 1 classified observations of species 1 (S. repens) correctly 91% of the time, and of species 2 (S. etonia) correctly 93% of the time. While the model is not perfect, it does have a very high accuracy rate. The model could potentially be improved if other strong predictor variables could be found and included."
