This report investigates the passage of coho salmon, coho jacks, and steelhead trout through Willamette Falls from January 2001 through December 2010. The Willamette Falls Fishway consists of three fish ladders that facilitate the movement of fish across the waterfalls. This passage is especially important for migratory species, such as salmon and steelhead trout, which must migrate upstream to spawn. The data used for these analyses come from scientific observations of the fish passing through the ladders of this fishway.

-   All examined fish species pass through the falls annually, at fairly regular intervals.
-   The peak passage times for coho and jack coho are aligned, and happen within a fairly short time window.
-   Steelhead pass through the falls across a wider time window, with less well-defined peaks, compared to coho and jack coho counts.

fish_ts_select %>%

  labs(x = "Date", y = "Number of Fish", 
       title = "Seasonplot of Adult Fish Passage at Willamette Falls") +
  facet_wrap(~ species,
             nrow = 3,
             labeller = labeller(species = 
                                   c("coho" = "Coho",
                                     "jack_coho" = "Jack Coho",
                                     "steelhead" = "Steelhead")),

  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  theme_minimal()
```

-   The peak passage times for coho and jack coho are very well aligned in the fall of every year.
-   In the most recent years, observed peak counts for coho and jack coho have been higher than in the earlier 2000s.
-   Steelhead pass through the falls during many months of the year, with peak fish counts generally in the late spring and early summer months. Peak dates for steelhead passage seem to have shifted slightly later in recent years compared to in earlier years.

# Annual Counts

```{r}
### Group data by fish type and year
fish_ts_annual <- fish_ts_select %>% 
  index_by(year = ~year(.)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(annual_count = sum(count))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-annualCounts
#| fig-cap: Cumulative counts of each fish type (coho, jack coho, and steelhead) across each year of the study period.  

ggplot(data = fish_ts_annual, aes(x = as_factor(year), y = annual_count, color = species, group = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Number of Fish", title = "Annual Counts of Adult Fish Passage at Willamette Falls") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('darkslategray4', 'darkslategray3', 'darkseagreen3')) +
  facet_wrap(~ species,
             nrow = 3,
             labeller = labeller(species = 
                                   c("coho" = "Coho",
                                     "jack_coho" = "Jack Coho",
                                     "steelhead" = "Steelhead")),
             scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

-   Coho numbers increased noticeably in 2009 and 2010 compared to earlier years.
-   Jack coho numbers have fluctuated over the study period. It is unclear whether and how they are correlated to coho counts.
-   Steelhead numbers generally declined through the 2000s. However, in 2010 the counts appeared to increase, potentially signaling a rebound in population growth.
