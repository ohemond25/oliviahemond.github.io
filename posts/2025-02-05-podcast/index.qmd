This podcast episode was developed by myself and my colleague Natalie Smith using the software tool Descript. We wanted to discuss a recent scientific publication by Dr. Jay Chakraborty, which focused on the spatial and social determinants of air pollution exposure in the United States. We created a short, conversational podcast episode to help this important research reach a broader audience.
